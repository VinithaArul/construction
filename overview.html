       <p>   Vicky Construction Pvt Ltd. was founded in 1995 under the stewardship of Mr. B  S Vignesh, a qualified Civil Engineer. Since its inception, Vicky Construction has set higher standards for itself, inspired by the Sanskrit origin of its name, which means ‘endless pursuit’. It has grown into one of the most respected real estate companies in India, reputed for its transparent business practices and innovation. A truly successful journey over the last 27 years has seen the company grow by leaps and bounds, as it went about creating over 170 landmarks and 6000+ customers across Tamil Nadu
            
            In an endeavour to excel and set higher standards of performance and corporate governance, the management team has on board professionals from various other industries to head the Marketing, Technical, HR, Finance, Sales & Customer Relations, Branding, Legal systems, Management Representative for ISO Audits & Safety and Human Resource divisions.
            
            Vicky's core values of transparency, clear titles and ethical business practices, clearly set the company apart from the rest of the industry players. A strict adherence to statutory norms has earned Vicky the respect of the real estate industry and the admiration of numerous delighted customers.
            
            A sincere belief that “ An educated customer is not a threat but in fact is a customer for life” saw Vicky launch a consumer awareness initiative called Vicky Home Facts” through which customers are educated on all the nuances involved in purchase of real estate property.
